# Baudtime

The goal of Baudtime is to make Prometheus more scalable, and provide extremely high write throughput.

## Features
* Designed for high throughput via TCP pipeline
* Global querying view across all data shards, gateways are stateless and can be scaled up arbitrarily
* Horizontally scalable, datanodes can be extended, you can send the metrics to multiple machines in one cluster and run "globally aggregated" across all data in a single place
* Highly available, data is replicated between master and its slaves and master can be failovered automatically by promoting a slave to be the new master
* Various strategies of load balancing over master and its slaves
* Compatible with prometheus data model(time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
* Compatible with PromQL and the query api of prometheus server, thus can be used with external tools such as Grafana
* Compatible with the write api of prometheus pushgateway
* Multi-language clients support, [java](https://github.com/baudtime/client_java) and go
* Multi-protocol support, tcp and http
* Flexible to deploy: single-process, deploy gateway and datanode separately or 2in1
* Push model
* A [plugin-driven agent](https://github.com/baudtime/agent) for collecting & reporting metrics is provided

## Building from source
    $ go get github.com/baudtime/baudtime/cmd/baudtime
    $ baudtime -log.level=info -log.file=your_log_file -config.file=your_config.toml

## Performance
Performance [comparison of a single node](https://github.com/baudtime/baudtime/tree/master/cmd/comparison) were made using an i5-7200U CPU with 8GB of RAM on Archlinux.
